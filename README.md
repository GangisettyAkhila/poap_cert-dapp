# 🎟️ POAP Certificate DApp on Algorand

This is a **Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP)** smart contract DApp built on the **Algorand blockchain**. It allows organizers to issue **verifiable certificates or badges** to participants of events (workshops, hackathons, meetups, etc.) using **Algorand smart contracts**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Mint on-chain POAP certificates for event attendees
- ✅ Issue, revoke, and query certificates programmatically
- ✅ Certificates are **tamper-proof**, **verifiable**, and **permanent**
- ✅ Issued using **Algorand smart contracts** (Algopy)
- ✅ Fully programmable via Python scripts (issue, revoke, verify)

---

## 🧠 Use Case

Most college events and workshops issue certificates via PDF — which are easily faked, lost, or unverifiable. This DApp solves the problem by issuing a **blockchain-based proof of attendance**, visible to anyone on-chain, and fully verifiable through smart contract queries.
